# Single-cell RNA-seq in a choroid plexus from a multiple sclerosis mouse model

## Background
Multiple sclerosis poses some challenges in the neurological disorders field and introduces many questions enven though there is a constant and progressive research, so it demands further exploration. The choroid plexus has recently gained attention as an important role in multiple sclerosis and has a potential to be the cause of neuroinflammation in this condition, however the knowledge about its role is still very vage.

## Project Objectives
The purpose of this project is to use single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify and characterize choroid plexus cells' response to multiple sclerosis. By analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data from a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, the objective is to determine the inflammatory conditions involved in the disease's pathogenesis. Through analysis using established pipelines, the project aims to compare cellular composition and transcriptome profiles of different cell types in the choroid plexus under healthy conditions and in the context of multiple sclerosis. Ultimately, the project will adress rthis condition's progression regarding choroid plexus relation.

## Significance of the Projetc
Our effort holds many implications for understanding the processes behind multiple sclerosis progression. The interpretation of the correlation between immune cells, the choroid plexus microenvironment and other factors will help us get on a goood track in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis because might guide the discovery of potential therapies and interventions aimed to slow down the progression of this disorder.
